- 👋 Hi, I’m @xtpwd
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, biology, robotics, aerospace engineering, European languages and classical music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of computer science, java and C programming language. On the artistic side of my personality, I am learning to play the violin.
