- 👋 Hi, I’m @greptux
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, biology, aerospace engineering, European languages and classical music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of computer science and front-end development.
-    I'm also a polyglot to be. I love languages. I can speak Chinese(my mother tongue), English, Spanish and French. Now I'm learning German.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on translation or some simple project or part of the project I can contribute.
- 📫 Contact me if there is anything I can help.
